# Roam Research Themes
McReaper is a custom CSS Theme for [Roam Research](http://roamresearch.com). 

It's based off [Maggie Appleton](https://twitter.com/mappletons?lang=en)'s theme [Mappletons](https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/mappletons.css) with a few tweaks.

The colours can all be changed with CSS variables which you'll find at the top of the stylesheet. 

For example, you can change all of the link colours by changing the primary colour variable.
